# Neural-Network-from-scratch
This repository contains the implementation of a neural network built entirely from scratch without relying on any external machine learning libraries. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts in deep learning, including forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent optimization, all implemented using basic Python constructs.
